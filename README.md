# **Description**
## We will code the mobile game Tap Titans 2 for our project. The game revolves  around tapping the screen, but for our version, we will use keyboard clicks to to track the amount of "taps". The player will fight through waves of titans followed by a boss. There will be ways to increase the player's damage along the way, such as hiring heroes, getting equipments, unlocking skills,  collecting artifacts, and leveling up the things mentioned above.
